Complex unfortune is a game based on darkest dungeon 1 & 2 with the feature of playing with friends. It was also used as a study object to learn multiplayer in godot 4.3.

## Idea

The main idea is that each part of your team is assigned to a player, who can hinder or help you in certain situations.

## What has been done?

For the time being only the lobby, when the project becomes active again the game will be completed.
